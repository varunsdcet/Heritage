<h2>Learning objectives</h2>
<ul>${bullets}</ul>
<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>Employers expect learners to understand both the concept and the day-to-day workflow. This reading builds the foundation before the instructor lecture and practice activities.</p>
<h2>Core concepts</h2>
<p>Work through each idea carefully. Take notes on definitions, common mistakes, and the handoff points between roles.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read the workplace context for this chapter.</li>
  <li>Identify the decision points and documentation needed.</li>
  <li>Connect the idea to a tool, form, or conversation you would use on the job.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Worked example</h2>
<p>Imagine ${place}. A request arrives late in the day. You clarify the purpose, choose the right process for ${seed.focus[0].toLowerCase()}, record what you did, and confirm the next owner of the task. Follow your site procedure and supervisor when safety or regulated steps apply.</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy and tone matter as much as speed.</li>
  <li>Clear records protect clients, staff, and the organization.</li>
  <li>Finish reading part 2, then watch the instructor lecture before the practice quiz.</li>
</ul>`;
  }
  return `<p>Part 2 deepens “${seed.title}” with applied practice and quality checks in ${place}.</p>
<h2>Applied checklist</h2>
<ul>${bullets}</ul>
<h2>Quality standards</h2>
<p>Before you mark work complete, verify spelling, required fields, privacy, and that the right person received the update. For trades and health steps, quote the course text and follow your site procedure and supervisor.</p>
<h2>Common mistakes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Starting work without clarifying the request</li>
  <li>Using the wrong template or tool</li>
  <li>Skipping confirmation or follow-up</li>
</ul>
<h2>Try it yourself</h2>
<p>Write a short action plan for a scenario involving ${seed.focus[1]?.toLowerCase() || seed.focus[0].toLowerCase()}. Include what you would check, who you would notify, and how you would store the record.</p>
<h2>Before the chapter assessment</h2>
<p>Review your notes, watch the lecture, complete the practice quiz and matching drill, then sit the graded chapter assessment.</p>`;
